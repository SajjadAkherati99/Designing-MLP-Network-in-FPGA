  Number of Slice LUTs:                      1,789 out of  27,288    6%
    Number used as logic:                    1,789 out of  27,288    6%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,769
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   20
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   623 out of   6,822    9%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        16 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,789
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,378 out of   1,789   77%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of   1,789    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         411 out of   1,789   22%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              25 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
